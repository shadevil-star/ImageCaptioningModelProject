The Flickr8k dataset with the ResNet50 model was used for image feature extraction. These features were used in an LSTM encode-decoder based model to create an Image Captioning Model. The model was batch trained using 
a generator to make the processing load lesser. This model needs certain improvements to make it a better image captioning model. Future changes include a transformer based model for caption generation instead of an 
LSTM based model.
